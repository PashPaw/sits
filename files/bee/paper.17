	The approach I will take in this paper is to describe the historical evidence
on the destruction of tissues in the temporal lobes, and then show how these historical
precedents have led to the purported therapeutic use of the removal of these tissues.
	Probably the first, and one of the more influential reports on the effects of
temporal lobotomies in animals, was the research done by Heinrich Kluver and Paul Bucy
in the period of time around 1937. Kluver and Bucy experimented with bilateral temporal
lobectomies in various types of monkeys.  In the monkeys that were lobotimized, they 
found 4 types of irregularities.  The first of which was "psychic blindness".
This is a term that they coined to describe the lack of visual recognition in monkeys that had had the  temporal
lobotomies.  These monkeys would approach inanimate and animate objects without hesitation.
They were not afraid of objects that would have elicited an avoidance response prior to 
the operation.  They also had the peculiar problem of not being able to recognize objects
unless they brought them to their mouths.  They were extrordinarily curious, and would try
to investigate everything in their sight.  This seemed to be a forced response, as they
seemed not to be able to choose if they were going to examine an object.  The mere fact
that it was in their visual field, illicited a response.  They also seemed to forget which objects they
have investigated before, and would return time and time again to scrutinize them again.
Kluver and Bucy also reported a strange tameness about of the monkeys.  All of the monkeys
chosen for the experiment were supposed to be "wild".  One of their monkeys
was a rhesus monkey, which are usually very violent with objects around them.  A normal
rhesus monkey will pick up objects, tear them apart and carry them with him.  The lobotomized
monkey would only pick up inedible objects long enough to bring them to his mouth, decide
they weren't edible, and then to discard them.  He never carried the objects an appreciable
distance.  In spite of these seemingly sensory defects, by several observations, Kluver and Bucy
discarded that possibility.  Unfortunately, there was no quantitative data, and their
arguments were some what less than convincing.  The conclusion that there were not
defects in the visual system was based on data accumulated by the dissection of the brains
of a couple of the monkeys.  This data is not as convincing as would be the results from
a specific experiment.
	The second historical experiments on animals, of interest is that made by
James W. Woods.  He performed bilateral temporal lesions on Norway rats about 1956.
The common Norway rat is fierce, aggressive and will fight with other rats or animals
many times his size.  When used as a laboratory animal, extreme caution must be used
in handling them.  They will escape whenever possible, and recapture is difficult.  When
they are handled, it is necessary to use heavy gloves to avoid severe injury.  Woods
took 42 of these animals, and performed bilateral lesions of the amygloid nuclei.  These
lesions were performed in one of two ways; either surgically, or by electrical destruction
of tissue.  The exact details of the procedure of causing these lesions was not mentioned.
In order to obtain good control data, he collected it in 4 ways.  First, he
recorded the behavior of all rats before and after the lesions.  Second, he performed 
the lesions on different time schedules.  Some of the lesions were made bilaterally in
one operation, the others were made in two operations, the intervening time ranging from
several weeks to several months.  Third, rats that were captured at the same time as the
rats that were lesioned, were kept in the same environment as the lesioned ones, and
finally, some rats were anesthetized, and operated on, but no lesions made.  In the
period of study that followed the operations, no change in the behavior of the control
rats was noted.  In that same time, the lesioned rats became, at least temporarily
tame.  Out of the 42 rats operated on, all became tame immediately after the operation,
and could be handled without the use of gloves,  however, after a few days or weeks,
11 of these rats became wild again.  The remaining
31 continued to be tame for the duration of the experiment, a period of up to 3 years.  In order to test the ferocity of the rats, they had an apparatus called the "fighting
chamber", which consisted of a cage with electrodes on the floor, so that they could
administer a shock to the bottoms of the feet of the rat.  Then they would put two rats
into the cage, and stimulate them with an electric shock.  With unlesioned rats, this
caused a fierce battle, usually ending in the death of one of the rats.  When the lesioned
rats were placed in this cage and stimulated, they rarely if ever attacked the other
rat.  They also put white mice in the same cage with the rats.  With normal rats, the
mice were killed in a matter of seconds, whereas with the lesioned rats, the mice were
rarely bothered, and in some cases, they exhibited response that was characz2y4zed by
Woods as "a maternal-like grooming behavior" toward the mice.  Woods then later disected
some of the rats to ascertain the extent of the damage made by the lesions, and found
that the lesions had been confined to the small area called the rhinencephalic structure.
	Now with the historical basis out of the way, we proceed into experimentation
on humans.  At the Massachusetts General Hospital, two surgeons, Vernon H. Mark M.D. and
Frank R. Ervin M.D., conducted experiments on the possible reduction of violence in humans
by the destruction of selected portions of the temporal lobes.  Their research in the field of
epilepsy in the temporal lobes, led them to temporal lobotomies to control other types
of personal violence.  In the case of a woman called Mary C., who became epileptic
later in life, drugs would not control her epilepsy.  When she had a grand mal seizure
she would sometimes go into an uncontrollable rage, beating her family, and once trying
to stab her husband.  After localizing the source of the epilepsy to her temporal lobes,
, she underwent surgery for stereotactic destruction of the left amygdala.  This did not
stop her fits, but it controled her rages.  In addition to using this technique to try
to control epilepsy, they also tried it to control other violent behavior cases.  There
was an aged lady, Clara T., who had temporal epilepsy.  She underwent a partial temporal
lobotomy on the left side of her brain.  When this did not improve her condition, she then
underwent stereotactic destruction of her other temporal lobe.  This according to Ervin
and Mark has almost eliminated her rages, but she still has seizures.  This case is particularly
interesting, because before her first temporal lobe was removed, she would occasionally
have fits of durations of 1 to 3 minutes.  These original fits, however, were never violent.
They merely consisted of staring blankly into space and smacking her lips.  Her violent
behavior only occured after the removal of brain tissue.  It would seem that since the
temporal lesions did not help alleviate her seizures, and in fact only caused her to become
extremely violent, would tend to imply that the whole procedure was unnecessary and even
perhaps detrimental.  Mark and Ervin get very excited over the success of the second operation,
but I find it not very impressive.  Particularly disturbing about the attitudes of Mark
and Ervin is their attitude that all violent behavior arises from the malfunctioning of
the brain.  They state, with no proof offered:
We do not mean to say that all of these
brain-diseased people are violent.  What we are saying is that an appreciable percentage
of the relatively few individuals guilty of repeated personal violence are to be found
in this 5 to 10 per cent of the population whose brains do not function in a perfectly
normal way."  
This statement  hether correct or not, is out of place in a book describing a beneficial
surgical technique.  Then they go even further to suggest that these people should be
detected early, and then some how prevented from causing violence. They offer no method of implementation, which I tend to believe is because it is unreasonable to do.
I believe that surgeons
should not speculate on how to save society from violence by various operations on "defective brains".
But the example of what I consider to harbor the most negligence on the part of Mark and
Ervin, is the case of Thomas R.  He had an accident that caused destruction of part of
his temporal lobe.  This accident caused him to go into uncontrollable rages.  He would
assault his wife and yell that she was "carrying on with a neighbor".  Mark and Ervin
discovered that a discharge into a certain part of his brain caused a feeling of well-being.
They used this stimulation to partially eliminate his violence spells.  During on of these
times when he was stimulated (feeling unusually good), Mark and Ervin asked him to undergo
an operation that they considered necessary for his health.  In this altered state, he
agreed, however, when he was back in a normal disposition, he balked.  It took many weeks
for them to convince him to allow it.  In their description of him they characterized him
as "wild and unmanageable.  The idea of anyone's making a destructive lesion in his brain enraged him."
I wonder how many other people would be enraged by the same suggestion.  After the operation
they describe him:
"Thomas has not had a single episode of rage.  He continues, however, to have
an occasional epileptic seizure with periods of confusion and disordered thinking".
In actuality, it was his wife who talked him into having the operation, with a threat to
leave him, if he didn't.  Then after the operation, he left him for their neighbor.
Now, Thomas R., who Mark and Ervin described as "an extremely talented, inventive man"
cannot hold down a job, because of long periods of disorientation.  As a result of this
and another case, Mark and Ervin are now undergoing a law suit.  The attitudes of these
men I find hard to justify, along with their techniques.  The only examples of the operations
turning out well, are fiasco's.  It is not the place of society to apply behavior modification through the guise of beneficial surgery.
