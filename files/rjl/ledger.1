Dear Sirs:
.br
	Enclosed please find the application for drill charts from
Volume 1 of your Safe Man's Guide, appropriately notarized, and a
stamped self addressed envelope. Please note that I have all 5 of
the volumes on order and would very much appreciate it if you would
send all of the drill charts so that I do not have to go to
the trouble of having each application notarized when the remaining
books arrive.

.NOFILL

Sincerely,



Ronald J. Lebel
