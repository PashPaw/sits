Dear Sirs:
.BR
	Enclosed please find the copy of the HPC book "The Art of Manipulation"
which I ordered and recieved from you. I am returning this book because
I believe that it is not worth anywhere near its $52.50 price, since it
contains little information that could not be readily deduced, and the
little information it contains is poorly presented. I understand
that your normal return policy is to discount the price paid by 10%,
so I should obtain a credit of 47.25.
	Also, please send a copy of the Sargent and Greenleaf
combination lock spare parts catalog @ $35, applying my credit
to cover the purchase.

Sincerely,



Ronald J. Lebel
